Negatives of current elevator design
- There is no “close door” button.
- The emergency call button should be red instead of black.
- The placement of the buttons should be moved to where the emergency buttons are grouped, and the non-emergency buttons are grouped.
- The font on some of the buttons is faded making it difficult to see which button the user is pressing.
- The elevator has an explanation of what it is on the exterior on the bottom floor but is missing the explanation on the other floors.

### Getting B:
- Think about the common things that you use an elevator. List your most common uses and other more rare uses. Does the interface make doing those common things easier?

- Think about how the user interacts with the elevator. What is the common sequence of actions?

- How does the elevator support the user figure out how to make it work?

- How does the elevator provide feedback to the user?

- What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design?

- Suggest the improvements to make on the control interface. Sketch your solution. And justify your design decisions.
