Negatives of current elevator design
- There is no “close door” button.
- The emergency call button should be red instead of black.
- The placement of the buttons should be moved to where the emergency buttons are grouped, and the non-emergency buttons are grouped.
- The font on some of the buttons is faded making it difficult to see which button the user is pressing.
- The elevator has an explanation of what it is on the exterior on the bottom floor but is missing the explanation on the other floors.


Most common uses for an elevator
- Elevators are used to transport humans to different destinations/floors
- Elevators can also be used to carry heavier items up multiple floors making it more efficient for things to get places quicker

The interface on the elevator that is presented in the above picture could make things harder for people who are in a rush or are trying to carry a heavy load due to the button placement. 

Common Sequence of Actions in an Elevator
- User presses button to open door
- User walks in and presses their desired location
- User presses the close door button to speed up the process (depends on user)


- The elevator is able to interact well with the user through visuals and sound.
